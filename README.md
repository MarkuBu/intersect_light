# intersect_light
a mod for Minetest


This is based loosely on Paramat's Intersecting mod (https://github.com/paramat/intersecting). It creates a connected series of tunnels and caves, but with only two noise maps, so it operates a lot quicker and in less memory. It can be used with other cave systems or stand-alone. Personally, I recommend Caverealms (https://github.com/HeroOfTheWinds/minetest-caverealms).
